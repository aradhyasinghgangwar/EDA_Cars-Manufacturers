# EDA_CarComapnies
Exploratory Data Analysis on Cars and Companies dataset using Python
### Car Manufcaturers
Extracting insights from Cars Data of Automobile Companies.
### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
Cleaned and preprocessed the raw used cars data to remove any duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent formatting. The impact of this step is that it ensured the accuracy and completeness of the data, which in turn led to more reliable insights.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conducted EDA on the cleaned data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between variables. Used visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to gain insights into the distribution, correlation, and outliers of the data. The impact of this step is that it helped to identify key factors that affect used cars and informed the subsequent modeling stage.
## Data Processing and Visualization Tools: 
Utilized a combination of software tools such as Excel for data cleaning and manipulation, and Jupyter Notebook for data visualization. The impact of this step is that it allowed for efficient processing of large datasets and effective visualization of the data, making it easier to communicate insights and findings to stakeholders.
